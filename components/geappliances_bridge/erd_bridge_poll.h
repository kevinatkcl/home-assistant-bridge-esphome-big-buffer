 * @brief Polls ERDs and updates the ERD cache (polling mode)
 */

// =============================================================================
// MODULE GOAL
// =============================================================================
// Goal: Periodically poll a list of ERDs from the appliance and update their
//       values in the ERD cache; fulfill write commands received from MQTT.
//
// Responsibilities:
//   - Maintain and iterate a fixed-capacity polling list
//   - Drive a tiny_hsm for probe discovery, polling, and appliance-lost recovery
//   - Accept a pre-built probe list to verify ERDs before polling
//   - Report polling health metrics (cycle count, last cycle time)
//
// NOT responsible for:
//   - Subscription-mode operation (see erd_bridge_subscribe.h)
//   - Bridge initialization or startup phase management
//
// ---- 3-Phase Polling Lifecycle ----
//
// Phase 1 — Build Verification List (no reads)
//   Determines which ERDs to probe in Phase 2. Contents depend on config:
//   - POLL or AUTO→poll, appliance_api_parsing=false:
//       commonErds + energyErds + applianceApiFeatureErds +
//       appliance-specific (erd_lists.h) + custom_erds
//   - POLL or AUTO→poll, appliance_api_parsing=true:
//       feature_bit_manager valid ERD list + custom_erds
//   - SUBSCRIBE or AUTO→subscribing:
//       custom_erds only (empty if none configured)
//
// Phase 2 — Verification (sequential reads; HSM states before state_polling)
//   Each ERD in the verification list is read once:
//   - read_completed             → register ERD + publish value → next ERD
//   - read_failed(not_supported) → permanently exclude          → next ERD
//   - read_failed(retries_exhausted) → skip, not added to polling list → next ERD
//   Result: erd_polling_list contains only ERDs that responded successfully.
//
// Phase 3 — Steady-State Polling (state_polling)
//   All registered ERDs are read sequentially each cycle. Timer semantics:
//   - Timer fires mid-cycle (cycle not yet complete):
//       set restart_pending=true; let the cycle finish naturally.
//   - Timer fires after cycle already complete:
//       start next cycle immediately; re-arm timer.
//   - Cycle completes with restart_pending=true:
//       start next cycle immediately; re-arm timer; clear restart_pending.
//   - Cycle completes, timer still armed:
//       wait for timer to fire.
//   - Cycle completes, timer not armed, no restart_pending:
//       start next cycle immediately; re-arm timer.
//
// Dependencies:
//   - i_tiny_gea3_erd_client.h, tiny_hsm.h, tiny_timer.h
//   - erd_lists.h (appliance ERD list arrays)
