  // Any bytes that arrive *during* event processing — e.g. the half-duplex
  // reflection of a byte just sent by send_next_byte(), or an appliance
  // response that begins arriving while send_ack() is executing — are deferred
  // to the next poll() call.
  // Without this guard, the receive loop can read the ACK-reflection while
  // packet_ready is still true (set by send_ack()), causing the subsequent
  // appliance response STX to be silently dropped in state_idle_cooldown
  // because the !packet_ready guard fails.  This manifests as ERD reads for
  // large payloads (e.g. 32-byte model number) always failing while small
  // payloads (e.g. 1-byte appliance type) succeed by chance.
