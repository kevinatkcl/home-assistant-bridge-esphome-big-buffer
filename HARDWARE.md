# Hardware Configuration

## Overview

This component is designed for use with the **FirstBuild Home Assistant Adapter** featuring the SeeedStudio Xiao ESP32-C3 microcontroller. It supports the GEA3 serial interface.

## FirstBuild Home Assistant Adapter

The FirstBuild Home Assistant Adapter consists of:
- [Xiao ESP32C3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Getting_Started/) microcontroller
- Custom carrier board with RJ45 jack for GEA3 serial connection
- Available from [FirstBuild](https://firstbuild.com/inventions/home-assistant-adapter/)

Reference repository: [geappliances/home-assistant-adapter](https://github.com/geappliances/home-assistant-adapter)

## Pin Configuration

### GEA3 (Newer Appliances)

The FirstBuild adapter uses the following pins for GEA3 communication:

```yaml
uart:
  - id: gea3_uart
    tx_pin: GPIO21  # D6 on Xiao ESP32-C3
    rx_pin: GPIO20  # D7 on Xiao ESP32-C3
    baud_rate: 230400
```

**Pin Mapping:**
- GPIO21 = TX (to appliance RX)
- GPIO20 = RX (from appliance TX)

### GEA2 (Older Appliances, 19200 baud)

GEA2 appliances communicate at 19200 baud.  The component automatically
configures the required UART settings on ESP32 IDF builds.  For other
platforms (ESP32 Arduino, etc.) add `rx_full_threshold: 1` and
`rx_timeout: 1` explicitly to your UART block:

```yaml
uart:
  - id: gea2_uart
    tx_pin: GPIOX
    rx_pin: GPIOY
    baud_rate: 19200
    rx_full_threshold: 1   # required on non-IDF platforms (auto-configured on ESP32 IDF)
    rx_timeout: 1          # minimise idle-flush latency (auto-configured on ESP32 IDF)
```

> **Why these settings matter:** GEA2's inter-byte timeout is 6 ms.  At
> 19200 baud the ESP32 default `rx_full_threshold` is ~19 bytes (≈10 ms),
> so hardware buffers bytes in batches with ~10 ms gaps between deliveries.
> That 10 ms gap exceeds the 6 ms timeout, causing the receive FSM to abort
> large-ERD responses mid-packet (no ACK is ever sent).  With
> `rx_full_threshold: 1` every byte is delivered to software within ~0.1 ms
> of arrival, keeping the inter-byte gap well below the 6 ms limit.

## GEA3 Serial Connection

The GEA3 protocol requires:
- **Baud rate:** 230400 bps
- **Configuration:** 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1)
- **Voltage level:** 3.3V TTL

The FirstBuild adapter carrier board handles the RJ45-to-serial conversion automatically.

## Physical Connection

Connect the FirstBuild adapter to your GE Appliance's GEA3 port using a standard Ethernet cable (RJ45).

## Troubleshooting

### No Communication with Appliance

1. **Check physical connection** - Ensure RJ45 cable is firmly seated
2. **Verify appliance compatibility** - Confirm appliance uses GEA3 protocol
3. **Check power** - Ensure both adapter and appliance are powered on
4. **Review logs** - Enable DEBUG logging to see UART activity and autodiscovery results

### Testing Configuration

Enable DEBUG logging to verify UART activity:

```yaml
logger:
  level: DEBUG
```

Look for:
- UART initialization messages
- Autodiscovery broadcast results (board address and appliance type)
- ERD value updates
