## Document Types

### Specifications (`docs/spec/`)

Detailed behavioral contracts for each module. Follow the spec template exactly.

**Required sections** (in order):

1. **Overview** — Purpose, Responsibilities, Not Responsible For
2. **Interface** — Handle struct, vtable, public API table
3. **Behavior** — Numbered requirements with Rationale, Implementation, Verification
4. **Notes** — Design decisions, tradeoffs, known limitations

### Module Descriptions (`./module_descriptions/`)

Lightweight summaries for architecture overview. One paragraph of purpose, bullet list of responsibilities, bullet list of dependencies.

### Guides (`docs/guides/`)

Procedural documents. Use imperative voice ("Run the pipeline", "Configure the UART"). Include code blocks with real, tested examples.

### Reference (`docs/reference/`)

Lookup documents. Tables, not prose. Every config option, every topic pattern, every interface method.

### Architecture (`docs/architecture/`)

Diagrams (mermaid) with supporting text. C4 model: context → container → component.

## Formatting Conventions

### Headings

- `#` for document title only (matches filename).
- `##` for top-level sections.
- `###` for subsections.
- No `####` or deeper — restructure if you need that depth.

### Code Blocks

- Always specify language: ````cpp`, ````c`, ````yaml`, ````bash`, ````python`, ````json`.
- File paths in code blocks use the repo root as base: `components/geappliances_bridge/erd_cache.h`.
- For C declarations, show the full signature including qualifiers.

### Mermaid Diagrams

- Use `graph TB` or `graph LR` for structure; `sequenceDiagram` for flows.
- Every diagram must have a caption describing what it shows.
- Keep diagrams to one screen height; split complex diagrams into focused views.
- Every mermaid code block must start with a theme config line for consistent
  light/dark mode rendering:

  ```
  %%{init: {"theme":"neutral","themeVariables":{"primaryColor":"#4a90d9","primaryBorderColor":"#2c6a9e","primaryTextColor":"#1a1a1a","secondaryColor":"#d9e8f5","tertiaryColor":"#f0f0f0","lineColor":"#999999","fontFamily":"monospace","nodeBorder":"#888888"}}}%%
  ```
- For sequence diagrams, also include `actorBkg`, `actorBorder`, and
  `actorTextColor` in themeVariables (e.g. `#e8e8e8`, `#999999`, `#1a1a1a`).
- Use `classDef` for node styling with the shared color palette:

  | Category | Fill | Stroke |
  |---|---|---|
  | Actor / Appliance | `#e8e8e8` | `#999999` |
  | System / Bridge | `#d9e8f5` | `#2c6a9e` |
  | Protocol / External | `#e8f5e8` | `#388e3c` |
  | Framework / MQTT | `#e8e8f0` | `#5c6bc0` |
  | Component / Cache | `#f3e5f5` | `#7b1fa2` |
  | Hardware / Embedded | `#fff3e0` | `#e65100` |
  | Submodule / Terminal | `#e8f5e9` | `#2e7d32` |
  | Home Assistant / External | `#fce4ec` | `#880e4f` |
- In sequence diagrams, use self-messages (`X->>X: annotation`) for
  annotations instead of `Note` statements, which are unreliable across
  Mermaid versions. Avoid `*` italic markers in message text — GitHub's
  Mermaid parser treats them as line continuation.

### Tables

- Use for comparisons, config options, API methods, state transitions.
- Include a brief description before the table explaining what it shows.

### Cross-References

- Reference other docs with relative paths: `[ERD Cache spec](./spec/erd_cache.md)`.
- Reference source files with paths: `erd_cache.h` / `erd_cache.cpp`.
- Reference spec sections with `#` anchors: `[see Behavior §3.2](#32-error-handling)`.

### Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **ERD** | Entity-Relationship Data point, identified by a 16-bit hex ID |
| **GEA2 / GEA3** | GE Appliance protocol versions (serial bus protocols) |
| **Bridge** | The ESPHome component (this project) |
| **Appliance** | The GE appliance connected via serial bus |
| **Host address** | The appliance's address on the GEA bus |
| **Discovery** | Home Assistant MQTT discovery (publishing entity configs) |
| **Pipeline** | The build-time process converting ERD definitions to embedded data |

### Prohibited

- No emojis.
- No marketing language ("powerful", "revolutionary", "best-in-class").
- No vague references ("the system does X") — name the module.
- No inline HTML — use Markdown.
- No trailing whitespace.
- No lines longer than 120 characters (wrap prose, not code blocks).

## Spec Template

All new specs in `docs/spec/` must follow this template. See `docs/spec/spec-template.md` for the full version.
