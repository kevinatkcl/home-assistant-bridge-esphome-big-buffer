# GeappliancesBridge

## Purpose

The main ESPHome component class that orchestrates the entire GE Appliances bridge. It manages UART interfaces for GEA2/GEA3 protocols, drives the startup state machine, handles MQTT connection lifecycle, and coordinates all sub-managers (autodiscovery, device identity, feature bits, OTA cleanup, diagnostic sensor publishing).

## Public API

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `setup()` | Initialize timer group, UART adapters, ERD clients, GEA interfaces, managers |
| `loop()` | Drive protocol stack and startup HSM |
| `dump_config()` | Log current configuration and state |
| `get_setup_priority()` | Returns `setup_priority::DATA` (600) — after MQTT (50), same as UART |
| `teardown()` | Clean up bridges and MQTT adapter |

### Configuration Setters (called from `__init__.py` code generation)

| Setter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `set_gea3_uart(uart)` / `set_gea2_uart(uart)` | Configure UART interfaces |
| `set_client_address(address)` | Set the bridge's bus address (default 0xE4) |
| `set_device_id(id)` | Pre-configure a static device ID |
| `set_mode(mode)` | Set bridge mode: POLL (0), SUBSCRIBE (1), or AUTO (2) |
| `set_polling_interval(ms)` | Set polling interval (default 10000 ms) |
| `set_appliance_api_parsing(bool)` | Enable feature bit-based ERD filtering (default true) |
| `set_generate_device_config(bool)` | Enable/disable HA device config generation (default true). When enabled, HA discovery runs on OTA reboot. The Discovery Refresh button always works regardless of this flag. Normal boots skip discovery (topics retained by MQTT broker). |
| `set_erd_publish_rate_sensor(sensor)` | Set sensor for ERD publish rate monitoring |
| `set_erd_cache_entries_sensor(sensor)` | Set sensor for ERD cache entries count |
| `set_erd_cache_updates_sensor(sensor)` | Set sensor for ERD cache updates count |
| `set_mqtt_publish_rate_sensor(sensor)` | Set sensor for MQTT publish rate monitoring |
| `set_throttle_rate_seconds(rate)` | Set minimum interval (seconds) between publishes per ERD (default 1, range 0-255) |
| `add_custom_erd(erd)` | Add a custom ERD to poll |
## Protected Methods

| `handle_erd_client_activity_(args)` | Route ERD activity to appropriate manager (device identity, feature bits, subscription ERD tracking) |
| `should_route_to_feature_bits_(erd)` | Decide whether an ERD read goes to FeatureBitManager or DeviceIdentityManager |
| `initialize_mqtt_client_()` | Create and configure the MQTT client adapter |
| `initialize_erd_bridge_()` | Initialize subscription or polling bridge based on mode |
| `init_erd_cache_publisher_()` | Initialize the ERD cache MQTT publisher and HA discovery manager |
| `init_polling_bridge_(log_as_info)` | Initialize the polling bridge with the probe list |
| `run_protocol_stack_()` | Drive GEA2/GEA3 hardware (includes GEA2 tight loop) |
| `update_publisher_state_()` | Publisher pause/resume during HA discovery + discovery_just_resumed_ tracking |
| `start_feature_bit_reading_()` | Start the feature bit read sequence |
| `start_custom_erd_polling_()` | Initialize polling for user-configured custom ERDs |
| `maybe_start_custom_erd_polling_()` | Guarded entry point for custom ERD polling (prevents re-initialization) |
| `log_poll_state_transitions_()` | Debug: log polling HSM state changes |
| `on_poll_discovery_complete_()` | Callback from polling bridge when probe phase completes |
| `trigger_discovery_refresh()` | Queue a discovery cleanup + republish + reboot. Public method (was protected). Delegates to `ota_cleanup_manager_.trigger_discovery_refresh()`. If pressed before steady state/MQTT/device ID are ready, the request is queued and executes once the bridge is ready. |

The bridge progresses through a linear sequence of phases via the `startup_hsm_`:

```
startup_delay → autodiscovery → device_id → mqtt_client_init
             → feature_bits → bridge_init → subscription_watch
             → running
```

## Bridge Initialization Flow

During `startup_state_bridge_init`, `initialize_erd_bridge_()` runs:

1. **Apply ERD filter**: If appliance API parsing is enabled and complete, sets the valid-ERD filter on the registry.
2. **Select mode**: Determines polling vs. subscription based on mode setting and GEA2/GEA3 protocol.
3. **Build probe list**: Calls `build_poll_list_()` (which delegates to `erd_poll_list_builder`) to build the list of ERDs to probe.
4. **Initialize bridges**:
   - **Polling mode**: Initializes `erd_bridge_poll_` with the probe list, known host address, and appliance type.
   - **Subscription mode**: Initializes `erd_bridge_subscribe_` with the known host address.
   - **Write bridge**: Always initialized with the real host address (updated after appliance identification).

## Dependencies

- ESPHome `Component` base class
- ESPHome `uart::UARTComponent` — UART interfaces
- ESPHome `mqtt::MQTTClientComponent` — MQTT client
- `tiny_gea3_interface`, `tiny_gea3_erd_client` — GEA3 protocol stack
- `tiny_gea2_interface`, `tiny_gea2_erd_client` — GEA2 protocol stack
- All sub-managers: `AutodiscoveryManager`, `DeviceIdentityManager`, `FeatureBitManager`
- Adapters: `esphome_uart_adapter`, `esphome_mqtt_client_adapter`, `gea2_erd_client_adapter`
- Bridges: `erd_bridge_subscribe`, `erd_bridge_poll`, `erd_write_bridge`
- `erd_poll_list_builder` — builds the probe list for the polling bridge
- `erd_registry` — single owner of valid-ERD filter, string-type set, and registered-ERD tracking
- `erd_cache_mqtt_publisher` — drains ERD cache updates to MQTT each `loop()`
- `erd_bridge_common.h` — shared signals, timing constants, and utility templates
- `OtaCleanupManager` — owns the OTA-triggered cleanup → republish → reboot state machine and the DiscoveryRefresh path
- `DiagnosticSensorPublisher` — owns periodic publishing of diagnostic sensor values (ERD/MQTT publish rate, cache stats, disconnect stats)
- `tiny_hsm`, `tiny_timer` — state machine and timer infrastructure

## Key Design Decisions

- **GEA2 tight loop**: When GEA2 is active, a 100 ms wall-clock busy loop ensures the full TX→RX cycle at 19200 baud completes within a single `loop()` call. A manual millisecond counter drives the GEA2 interface's internal timers without starving the shared timer group.
- **Bridge modes**: Three modes — POLL (always poll), SUBSCRIBE (always subscribe), AUTO (try subscribe, fall back to polling after 10 s if no activity).
- **IBridgeServices interface**: `GeappliancesBridge` implements `IBridgeServices`, the abstract contract consumed by the startup HSM. This eliminates `friend` declarations and lets the HSM be unit-tested with a mock.
- **Phase timeouts**: Device ID phase has a 30 s timeout, feature bits phase has a 60 s timeout — both prevent the startup HSM from stalling indefinitely.
- **Probe list ownership**: The `poll_probe_list_` member stores the built probe list so the pointer passed to `erd_bridge_poll_init()` remains valid across the probe phase.
- **loop() delegation:** `loop()` delegates ongoing work to `ota_cleanup_manager_.loop()` (OTA cleanup, discovery refresh, reboot) and `diagnostic_sensor_publisher_.loop()` (periodic diagnostic sensor publishing) instead of driving them inline.

## Testing

Covered by integration tests in `test/tests/` that exercise the full startup sequence, mode switching, and error recovery paths.
