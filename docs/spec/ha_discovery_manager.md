# HA Discovery Manager — Specification

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The HA Discovery Manager generates and publishes Home Assistant MQTT discovery payloads for GE Appliances devices. It decompresses embedded JSONL entity definitions (stored as zlib-compressed data in `ha_discovery_data.h`), parses each line to extract entity metadata, builds a valid Home Assistant discovery payload, and publishes it to the appropriate `homeassistant/{domain}/{device_id}/{entity_id}/config` topic with `retain=true`.

Discovery runs once at device startup. The manager processes categories relevant to the appliance type, filtering out entities whose ERDs are not registered in the device's ERD cache.

### 1.2 Responsibilities

- Build a sorted ERD list from the cache for binary-search filtering
- Decompress embedded JSONL chunks sequentially (one at a time into a shared buffer)
- Parse JSONL lines and extract entity fields (name, domain, ERD ID, templates, etc.)
- Filter entities by checking ERD registration (binary search on sorted array)
- Build Home Assistant discovery payloads with proper JSON escaping
- Publish discovery payloads to MQTT (one entity per `run()` call)
- Track discovery progress (categories, chunks, lines) with cooperative yielding via early return
- Transition through well-defined states: IDLE → BUILDING → DISCOVERING → COMPLETE/FAILED
- Manage embedded cleanup module for removing stale discovery topics

### 1.3 Not Responsible For

- ERD cache lifecycle (owned by `GeappliancesBridge`)
- MQTT connection lifecycle (owned by `EsphomeMqttClientAdapter`)
- Generating or updating ERD data values (handled by `erd_cache_mqtt_publisher`)
- Determining which ERDs are registered (set by polling/subscription bridges)
- Parsing the raw JSONL schema (entity definitions are pre-compiled into embedded data)

## 2. State Machine

### 2.1 States

```c
typedef enum {
  ha_discovery_state_idle,        // Initial state after init()
  ha_discovery_state_building,    // Build phase complete; awaiting first run() call
  ha_discovery_state_discovering, // Main loop decompressing/publishing
  ha_discovery_state_complete,    // All entities published
  ha_discovery_state_failed       // Decompression error during discovery
} ha_discovery_state_t;
```

### 2.2 Transitions

```
IDLE ──start()──> BUILDING ──run()──> DISCOVERING ──all categories done──> COMPLETE
  │                                   │
  │                                   └──decompress fail──> FAILED
  │
  └──start() [non-ESP-IDF]──> COMPLETE
```

- **IDLE → BUILDING**: `start()` builds the sorted ERD list and device JSON inline on ESP-IDF. On non-ESP-IDF, transitions directly to COMPLETE.
- **BUILDING → DISCOVERING**: First `run()` call transitions state and initializes discovery counters.
- **DISCOVERING → COMPLETE**: `run()` finishes all categories and chunks.
- **DISCOVERING → FAILED**: `chunk_decompress()` fails for any chunk.

### 2.3 State Guards

- `start()` only proceeds from IDLE; calls in other states are no-ops.
- `run()` only proceeds from BUILDING or DISCOVERING; calls in other states return immediately.

---

## 3. Initialization

### 3.1 Init

```c
void ha_discovery_manager_init(ha_discovery_manager_t* self);
```

`init()` MUST:
- Zero the struct with `memset`
- Set `state = ha_discovery_state_idle`
- On ESP-IDF:
  - Initialize embedded `cleanup` module via `ha_discovery_cleanup_init()`

### 3.2 Configure

```c
void ha_discovery_manager_configure(
  ha_discovery_manager_t* self,
  const char* device_id,
  const char* model_number,
  const char* serial_number,
  uint8_t appliance_type,
  bool filter_config_topics,
  erd_cache_t* cache,
  i_mqtt_client_t* mqtt_client);
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `device_id` | Device ID string used in topic construction and unique IDs. |
| `model_number` | Model number for device info in discovery payloads (may be NULL). |
| `serial_number` | Serial number for device info in discovery payloads (may be NULL). |
| `appliance_type` | ERD 0x0008 appliance type value, used for category filtering. |
| `filter_config_topics` | Whether to filter discovery topics (stored for future use). |
| `cache` | Shared ERD cache for building the sorted ERD list. |
| `mqtt_client` | MQTT client interface for publishing discovery payloads. |

`configure()` stores all parameters directly; no validation or deep copy.

### 3.3 Start

```c
void ha_discovery_manager_start(ha_discovery_manager_t* self);
```

On ESP-IDF:
- Guard against non-IDLE state
- Build the sorted ERD list from the cache via `build_sorted_erd_list()` (inline, no background task)
- Build the device JSON string via `build_device_json()` (inline)
- Set `state = ha_discovery_state_building`

On non-ESP-IDF:
- Set `state = ha_discovery_state_complete` (no discovery work to do)

### 3.4 Cleanup

```c
void ha_discovery_manager_cleanup(ha_discovery_manager_t* self);
```

On ESP-IDF:
- Call `cleanup_resources()` which calls `ha_discovery_cleanup_destroy()` on the embedded cleanup module
- Zero the struct with `memset`

On non-ESP-IDF:
- Zero the struct with `memset`

### 3.5 Run

```c
void ha_discovery_manager_run(ha_discovery_manager_t* self);
```

Called from the main loop. See §5 for the full run loop behavior.

On non-ESP-IDF: no-op.

### 3.6 Query Functions

```c
bool ha_discovery_manager_is_processing(ha_discovery_manager_t* self);
```

Returns `true` if state is BUILDING or DISCOVERING.

```c
ha_discovery_state_t ha_discovery_manager_get_state(ha_discovery_manager_t* self);
```

Returns the current state.


---

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 ESP-IDF: Inline Build + Main Loop Discovery

On ESP-IDF, discovery is split into two phases:

**Build phase (inline in `start()`):**
- `start()` calls `build_sorted_erd_list()` to iterate the ERD cache, deduplicate, and sort ERD IDs via insertion sort
- `start()` calls `build_device_json()` to pre-build the device JSON fragment (identifiers, name, manufacturer, model, serial)
- No background task is created; all work is synchronous

**Discovery phase (main loop):**
- `run()` is called from the main loop
- First call in BUILDING state: transitions to DISCOVERING, initializes progress counters
- Subsequent calls in DISCOVERING state: decompresses chunks and publishes one entity per call, returning to the main loop between publishes

### 4.2 Non-ESP-IDF: No-Op

On non-ESP-IDF platforms, `start()` transitions directly to COMPLETE and `run()` is a no-op. Discovery is not supported in simulator/test builds without ESP-IDF stubs.

---

## 5. Data Flow

### 5.1 Embedded Data Structure

Discovery entity definitions are stored as compressed JSONL in `ha_discovery_data.h`:

```
ha_discovery_categories[] (10 categories)
  └── ha_discovery_category_t
        ├── name: "common", "refrigeration", "laundry", ...
        ├── data: pointer to compressed bytes
        ├── chunks: ha_discovery_chunk_t[] (offset + compressed size)
        ├── num_chunks: number of chunks
        └── max_decompressed_chunk: max decompressed size for any chunk
```

Each category's data is zlib-compressed and split into one or more chunks. Chunk descriptors specify the byte offset and compressed size within the category's data array.

**Categories and compression ratios:**

| Category | Chunks | Compressed | Decompressed | Ratio |
|----------|--------|------------|--------------|-------|
| common | 1 | 2,124 B | 7,023 B | 3.3× |
| refrigeration | 24 | 32,752 B | 320,080 B | 9.8× |
| laundry | 42 | 80,771 B | 554,481 B | 6.9× |
| dishwasher | 4 | 7,388 B | 46,074 B | 6.2× |
| waterheater | 2 | 3,671 B | 25,617 B | 7.0× |
| range | 45 | 59,563 B | 611,235 B | 10.3× |
| airconditioning | 5 | 10,784 B | 67,408 B | 6.3× |
| waterfilter | 1 | 604 B | 1,664 B | 2.8× |
| smallappliance | 12 | 14,576 B | 154,869 B | 10.6× |
| energy | 1 | 896 B | 5,505 B | 6.1× |

### 5.2 Processing Pipeline

```
Category iteration → Chunk decompression → Line parsing → Entity filtering → Payload building → MQTT publish
```

1. **Category iteration**: Walk `ha_discovery_categories[]` from index 0 to `ha_discovery_category_count - 1`
2. **Category filtering**: `should_process_category()` checks if the category is relevant for the configured `appliance_type`
3. **Chunk decompression**: For each chunk in the category, decompress into `decomp_buf` (18 KB) using `miniz/tinfl`
4. **Line parsing**: Scan the decompressed buffer for newline-delimited JSON lines, copying each into `line_buf` (18 KB)
5. **Entity filtering**: `process_jsonl_line()` extracts ERD ID and checks registration via binary search on the sorted ERD array
6. **Payload building**: Build the Home Assistant discovery payload in `payload_buf` (8 KB) with proper JSON escaping
7. **MQTT publish**: Publish to `homeassistant/{domain}/{device_id}/{entity_id}/config` with `retain=true`
8. **Cooperative yield**: After each publish, `run()` returns to the main loop, allowing other tasks to run before the next entity

### 5.3 Chunk Processing

The manager processes one chunk at a time into the shared `decomp_buf`. Once a chunk is fully consumed (all lines parsed), it decompresses the next chunk into the same buffer — no need to keep all decompressed data in memory simultaneously.

**Progress tracking:**
- `current_category`: index into `ha_discovery_categories[]`
- `current_chunk`: index into current category's `chunks[]`
- `current_offset`: byte offset within the current decompressed chunk
- `current_decomp_size`: size of the current decompressed chunk

When `current_decomp_size == 0`, the next chunk needs decompression. When `current_offset >= current_decomp_size`, the chunk is done and the manager advances to the next chunk.

### 5.4 JSONL Line Processing

`process_jsonl_line()` performs the following steps:

1. **Extract required fields**: `i` (ERD ID hex), `n` (entity name), `d` (domain)
2. **Extract optional fields**: `fi` (field ID), `p` (paired ERD), `r` (role), `u` (unit), `dc` (device class), `sc` (state class), `o` (options), `dt` (data type), `sf` (scale factor), `m` (mode), `pon` (payload on), `poff` (payload off), `son` (state on), `soff` (state off), `mn` (min), `mx` (max), `st` (step)
3. **ERD registration check**: Binary search the sorted ERD array; if not found, increment `total_filtered` and return `false`
4. **Paired ERD check**: If a paired ERD is specified, verify it is also registered
5. **Build unique ID**: `{device_id}_erd_{erd_id_hex}[_{field_id}]`
6. **Build topics**: state topic `geappliances/{device_id}/erd/0x{erd_id}/value`, command topic `geappliances/{device_id}/erd/0x{erd_id}/write`
7. **Paired entity topic swap**: For paired entities with `role="request"`, swap state and command topics between the primary and paired ERDs
8. **Build discovery topic**: `homeassistant/{domain}/{device_id}/{erd_id}[_{field_id}]/config` using a cached domain prefix
9. **Build payload**: Construct the JSON payload with all applicable fields, embedding `value_template` and `command_template` directly from the raw JSONL line
10. **Button domain special case**: Buttons omit `state_topic` and `value_template`, using `payload_press="1"` instead

**JSON helpers:**
- `json_get_str()`: Extracts a value for a given key from a JSON string, handling string values, objects, and arrays
- `json_unescape()`: Unescapes JSON string values (`\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\uXXXX`)
- `json_reescape()`: Copies a raw JSON value for embedding in another JSON string (no transformation needed — escape sequences remain valid)

---

## 6. Category Filtering

### 6.1 should_process_category()

Determines which categories to process based on `appliance_type` (ERD 0x0008). The `common` category is always processed. Each appliance type maps to one or more specific categories plus the `energy` category:

| Appliance Types | Categories |
|----------------|------------|
| 0 (WaterHeater) | waterheater, energy |
| 1, 2, 23, 45, 46 (Laundry) | laundry, energy |
| 3, 24, 25, 48, 51 (Refrigeration) | refrigeration, energy |
| 4, 5, 7–9, 11–13, 15, 17, 19, 34, 39–41, 43, 47, 49, 54 (Range/Cooking) | range, energy |
| 6, 32 (Dishwasher) | dishwasher, energy |
| 10, 14, 20, 22, 30, 31, 35, 36, 44, 52, 56 (Air Conditioning) | airconditioning, energy |
| 16, 21 (Water Filter) | waterfilter, energy |
| 18, 26–29, 33, 37, 38, 42, 50, 53, 55 (Small Appliance) | smallappliance, energy |

Appliance types not in any group (e.g., 42=SmartPlug) only get the `common` category.

---

## 7. Domain Mapping

### 7.1 Home Assistant Domains

The manager supports 21 Home Assistant domains, defined in `HA_DOMAIN_STRINGS[]`:

`alarm_control_panel`, `binary_sensor`, `button`, `camera`, `climate`, `cover`, `date`, `datetime`, `event`, `fan`, `light`, `lock`, `number`, `select`, `sensor`, `switch`, `text`, `time`, `update`, `vacuum`, `valve`

The domain for each entity comes from the JSONL data (field `d`), not from ERD ID mapping. The `ha_domain_to_index()` helper converts a domain string to its index in the array for validation.

### 7.2 Domain Topic Prefix Caching

To avoid repeated `snprintf` calls during discovery, the manager caches the domain topic prefix:

```c
char domain_topic_prefix[128];       // "homeassistant/{domain}/{device_id}/"
char current_domain_prefix_buf[32];  // Tracks current domain name
```

When the domain changes (or on first use), the prefix is rebuilt. Subsequent entities in the same domain reuse the cached prefix, concatenating only the entity suffix (`{erd_id}[_{field_id}]/config`).

---

## 8. Error Handling and Recovery

### 8.1 Build Phase

The build phase runs inline in `start()` with no heap allocation or background task. There are no failure modes for the build phase itself — `build_sorted_erd_list()` and `build_device_json()` operate on pre-allocated buffers within the struct.

### 8.2 Decompression Failure

If `chunk_decompress()` returns non-zero for any chunk:
- Log error with category name, chunk index, offset, and size
- Transition to FAILED state
- Discovery stops immediately — no further categories or chunks are processed

### 8.3 Payload Too Large

If the built payload exceeds `payload_buf` (8 KB):
- Log warning with the ERD ID
- Increment `total_filtered`
- Return `false` from `process_jsonl_line()` — the entity is skipped but discovery continues

### 8.4 ERD Not Registered

If the ERD ID (or paired ERD ID) is not found in the sorted ERD array:
- Increment `total_filtered`
- Return `false` from `process_jsonl_line()` — the entity is skipped but discovery continues

### 8.5 No Recovery

Once the state transitions to FAILED, there is no automatic recovery. The caller would need to re-initialize and re-start the manager.

---

## 9. Memory Management

### 9.1 Pre-allocated Buffers

All buffers are embedded in the struct — no heap allocation during discovery processing:

| Buffer | Size | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `decomp_buf` | 18,432 B | Decompression output (max chunk is ~18 KB) |
| `line_buf` | 18,432 B | JSONL line parsing (max line is ~18 KB) |
| `topic_buf` | 192 B | Discovery topic string |
| `payload_buf` | 8,192 B | Discovery payload JSON |
| `device_json_buf` | 512 B | Pre-built device JSON fragment |
| `entity_name_buf` | 160 B | Entity name from JSONL |
| `erd_id_hex_buf` | 8 B | ERD ID in hex |
| `domain_buf` | 32 B | Domain string from JSONL |
| `field_id_buf` | 72 B | Field ID from JSONL |
| `paired_erd_buf` | 8 B | Paired ERD ID |
| `role_buf` | 16 B | Role string (e.g., "request") |
| `unit_buf` | 32 B | Unit of measurement |
| `device_class_buf` | 32 B | Device class string |
| `state_class_buf` | 32 B | State class string |
| `options_buf` | 256 B | Options array (raw JSON) |
| `data_type_buf` | 16 B | Data type (e.g., "u8", "i16") |
| `scale_factor_buf` | 16 B | Scale factor |
| `min_buf` / `max_buf` / `step_buf` | 32 B each | Number domain bounds |
| `mode_buf` | 16 B | Input mode (e.g., "box", "slider") |
| `payload_on_buf` / `payload_off_buf` | 16 B each | Switch payloads |
| `state_on_buf` / `state_off_buf` | 16 B each | State mapping |
| `unique_id_buf` | 160 B | Unique ID for entity |
| `state_topic_buf` | 128 B | State topic string |
| `command_topic_buf` | 128 B | Command topic string |
| `actual_state_topic_buf` | 128 B | Effective state topic (may differ for paired entities) |
| `actual_command_topic_buf` | 128 B | Effective command topic (may differ for paired entities) |
| `domain_topic_prefix` | 128 B | Cached domain topic prefix |
| `current_domain_prefix_buf` | 32 B | Tracks current domain for prefix caching |
| `sorted_erds` | 1,290 B | Sorted ERD array (645 × 2 bytes) |

**Peak memory usage:**
- Struct size: ~54 KB (buffers embedded in struct)
- Decompression state: embedded `tinfl_decompressor` (~3 KB)

### 9.2 Heap Allocation

There are no heap allocations during discovery. All buffers are pre-allocated within the struct, and the build phase runs inline with no dynamic memory allocation.

### 9.3 Cleanup

`cleanup_resources()` calls `ha_discovery_cleanup_destroy()` on the embedded cleanup module.

`ha_discovery_manager_cleanup()` calls `cleanup_resources()` and then zeros the entire struct with `memset`.
---

## 10. Cooperative Processing

### 10.1 One Entity Per Call

`run()` publishes exactly one entity per call, then returns to the main loop. This keeps main-loop iteration times low and allows other tasks (MQTT callbacks, WDT feeding, etc.) to run between publishes. Filtered entities (ERD not registered, paired ERD not registered, payload too large) are also processed within the same call and do not cause a return — the inner loop continues to the next line until a publish succeeds or the chunk is exhausted.

### 10.2 Chunk Boundaries

After finishing all lines in a decompressed chunk, `run()` returns to the main loop before decompressing the next chunk. This avoids blocking the main loop while skipping empty or fully-filtered chunks.

---

## 11. Stats

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `total_discovered` | `uint32_t` | Total entities that passed filtering (ERD registered). |
| `total_published` | `uint32_t` | Total discovery payloads published to MQTT. |
| `total_filtered` | `uint32_t` | Entities skipped (ERD not registered, paired ERD not registered, or payload too large). |

`total_discovered` and `total_published` are incremented together on each successful publish. `total_filtered` is incremented when an entity is skipped for any reason.

---

## 12. Invariants

1. **No cache ownership:** The manager holds a raw pointer to the cache but never frees or modifies its lifecycle. Cache ownership belongs to `GeappliancesBridge`.
2. **No MQTT lifecycle ownership:** The manager does not create, connect, or destroy the MQTT client. It uses `mqtt_client_publish_raw()` for publishing.
3. **Sequential processing:** Only one chunk is decompressed at a time. Only one entity payload is built at a time. No item pool or queue is needed.
4. **All buffers pre-allocated:** No heap allocation occurs during the discovery phase (after `start()`). All entity field buffers, topic buffers, and payload buffers are embedded in the struct.
5. **Domain prefix caching:** The domain topic prefix is cached and reused for consecutive entities in the same domain, reducing `snprintf` calls.
6. **Clean destroy:** `cleanup()` calls `ha_discovery_cleanup_destroy()` on the embedded cleanup module and zeros the struct.

---

## 13. Dependencies

| Dependency | Role |
|------------|------|
| `erd_cache.h` | ERD cache iteration (`erd_cache_get_next_entry`) for building sorted ERD list |
| `i_mqtt_client.h` | MQTT publish interface (`mqtt_client_publish_raw`) |
| `ha_discovery_data.h` | Embedded compressed JSONL data (categories, chunks, raw bytes) |

## 14. Known Limitations

1. **No re-discovery after completion:** Once the state reaches COMPLETE, the manager does not support re-running discovery. To re-discover, the caller must call `init()`, `configure()`, and `start()` again.
2. **No partial re-publish:** If the MQTT broker restarts and loses retained messages, the manager does not re-publish discovery payloads. Only the initial startup run publishes them.
3. **Single device ID:** The manager is configured with one device ID at configure time. Supporting multiple devices would require multiple manager instances.
4. **Payload size limit:** The 8 KB payload buffer limits the complexity of discovery payloads. Entities with very large templates (e.g., complex Jinja2 expressions) may be skipped.
5. **No ESP-IDF stub support for decompression:** On simulator builds with `USE_ESP_IDF_STUBS`, `chunk_decompress()` always returns -1, causing discovery to fail. This is intentional — discovery is an ESP-IDF-only feature.
6. **Category filtering is static:** The mapping from appliance type to categories is hardcoded. Adding new appliance types or categories requires code changes.
7. **No discovery ordering guarantee:** Entities within a category are published in the order they appear in the JSONL data. There is no guarantee of a specific ordering across categories.
8. **Non-ESP-IDF builds skip discovery entirely:** On non-ESP-IDF platforms, `start()` transitions directly to COMPLETE and `run()` is a no-op. This is appropriate for simulator builds where MQTT discovery is not needed.
9. **JSONL schema is implicit:** The JSONL field names (`i`, `n`, `d`, `fi`, `p`, `r`, `u`, `dc`, `sc`, `o`, `dt`, `sf`, `m`, `pon`, `poff`, `son`, `soff`, `mn`, `mx`, `st`, `vt`, `ct`) are not documented in the code. The schema is defined by the tool that generates `ha_discovery_data.h`.
